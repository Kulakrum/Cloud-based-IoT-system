# Cloud-based-IoT-system

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?

This project constitutes building a Cloud-based and IoT home automation system that enables the users to automate functionalities in the assigned area and sends alerts in line with the designed features through the employment of various sensors.  
The development of smart homes involves multiple technological aspects, which include big data, mobile networks, cloud computing, Internet of Things, and even artificial intelligence. Digital information is the main component of signal control and flow in a smart home, while information security is another important aspect.

In this project, we used NodeMcu to connect to the internet via a wireless source. NodeMcu is a free-for-all IoT platform that incorporates System on a Chip (SoC) firmware that runs on the ESP8266. 
It is connected to other hardware using NodeMcuâ€™s General Purpose Input/output (GPIO) pins. It also uses the Arduino IDE for programming. Additionally, Node-Red incorporated, which is a flow-based visual programming development software helpful in stringing hardware, online services, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) together

JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECT

This project is aimed at basically providing flexibility as well as multitasking using Cloud based solutions and Internet of Things to provide lighting, security and real-time data access at your home so that the users can engage efficiently without so much pressure or worries and with ease of access

OBTAINING RESULTS

Results were obtained by connecting the prototype to a power source. The sensors acquired data then the node MCU sent the same data real-time to the Node-Red API as the interface for displaying data and sending commands to devices.
The end result was an efficient home management system that was able to automate devices in a home setup and provide a robust market standard
